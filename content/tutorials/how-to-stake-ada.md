## 2.8 Write down the recovery phrase

This step is very important!
If you loose access to your device on which you are creating this wallet, the only way to restore your wallet is by using this recovery phrase.
So make sure you write it down correctly at least one time. It's better to keep multiple copies of it in different locations.
Never store those words on your hard drive!

## 2.9 Verify the recovery phrase

After writing down the recovery phrase you have to confirm it by selecting the words in the right order.

## 3.2 Send the coins to this address

Now you have to send your ADA to this address.
Tutorials for different exchanges like Binance and Kucoin will follow.

## 3.3 Wait for the ADA to arrive

This can take up to 30 minutes depending on your exchange.
If you send the transaction directly from another wallet it should only take a few seconds.

# 4 Delegate (stake) your ADA

## 4.1 Select a stake pool

When selecting a stake pool make sure the pool size is smaller than 80% and has not more than 5% fees.
In my example I pick the Cardano in Africa pool which has only 2% fees.

That's it. You will now receive your reward every 5 days.
